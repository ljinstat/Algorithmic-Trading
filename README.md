# Algorithmic Trading
## 1. Moving Average :
As basic trading strategies, moving averages are useful tools to indicate trends and momentums. In rmarkdown "Moving Average", simple moving average, exponential moving average, crossover strategy and Bollinger Bands are introduced.
## 2. Mean Reversion Test
For detecting mean reversion property, Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is used. The nul hypothesis is that the time series is not a trend-stationary series. In "reversion.pdf", the test is explained in mathematical way. I used R and Python to show the result. The document in Python is partly referred to an article in quantstart.com. *However, in the part of Hust Exponent in this article, an expression is not related to mathematical formula.
In rmarkdown, I just showed a result of ADF.
